This silly application is my first attempt at utilizing the full stack.

To use the app the user will first type the name of the burger they wish to add. This burger will be added to the database and populate to a list on the left hand side of the website and include its unique id as well as a devour button.

When the user presses the devour button, the database will update the burger information to signify that it has been "eaten". This will also move it to the right side list of "eaten" burgers. The item will have its devour button replaced by an eat another button and digest button.

When the user presses the eat another button it will set the burger to "uneaten" in the database and move it to the left side as before. When the user presses the digest button it will delete it from both the right side list as well as the database.
